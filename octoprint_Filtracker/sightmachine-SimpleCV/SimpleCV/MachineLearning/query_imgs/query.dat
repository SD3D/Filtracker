#should be safe to use existing duplicate removal, even with hundreds of negative constraints
#what to do about spaces?  exclude those cities, or only search tags, or use AND
#spaces would screw up the negative constraints.  We should just eliminate all spaces-
#searching for "washingtondc" finds images tagged "washington dc"
#however, "washingtondc -washington" does not return any images tagged "washington dc", only "washingtondc"
#"mexicocity -mexico" works very badly
#"mexico -mexicocity" works as desired, though.  Or "washington -washingtondc"
#"newmexico -mexico" will cause problems.
#so we need to query from specific to general, cities, then states, then countries
#need to query west virginia before virginia

#metro areas, by population, top 100, decreasing
goldfish

#negative queries.  should these be restricted to tags only?
